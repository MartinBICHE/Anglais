## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ **Set Up the Environment**

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). You can check your Python version using:

```sh
python --version
```

Then, create a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- **Windows:**
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**

Install Flask and other required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` does not exist, manually install Flask:

```sh
pip install flask
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Run the Flask Application**

Start the Flask server:

```sh
flask run
```

By default, Flask runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your browser to access the application.

## 🗑 Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:

```sh
deactivate
```
